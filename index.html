<h2>A movie that absolutely tore my heart to shreds this year was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9x2pGc_y9o&ab_channel=DC" target="_blank">All-Star Superman
</a></h2>

<p class="description-one">Superman has been poisoned! <br /> The man of steel is dying from solar radiation!<br />Before he dies, he tends to his relationship with Lois Lane and reveals his secret identity to her. They share one last magical day before he sacrifices himself in order to save the world...

<p class="description-one" style="text-align:center;!important">I tried to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkD4GmfAsHY" target="_blank">superman red son</a> afterwards and it was not comparable. It was directed by the same person, <i>Sam Liu</i>, so I had high expectations but they were not met. Full disclosure: My roommate and I fell asleep midway through, I'm not sure if that lends credence to my review or not... I guess it does if I specify that I'm only refering to the beginning of the movie. I feel like the first 30 mins of a film usually sets the tone though.

<p class="description-two">This movie left such a massive impact because:<br /> <br /> 
<ol>
  <li> Everything touches me, I cry over a lost sock if the weather calls for such dramatics </li>
  <li> Nothing stings more than love lost  <i>forever-ever</i> </li>
  <li> The robots / his friends are really cute </li>
   <li> I loved the animation and the colors and the worlds he flew us to.. I felt so immersed in his life & in his death </li>
</ol>
